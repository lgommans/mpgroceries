Wishlist:

- Assign items to store(s) where you typically buy it and group/color by that.

- Testing for XSS is TODO.

- CSRF protection. At least there is anti-CSRF on the logout :D
  Hmm, so I guess that means you can delete a user's data, but you can't
  "vaccinate" users from other CSRF attacks by means of a CSRF attack... maybe
  I should temporarily remove this security feature :P

- Unify style, put css/js in files


Notes:

- Global PHP variables should be underscore-prefixed. I only recently started
  doing this and only bothered to change the $_ok and config.php variables
  everywhere. There may be others, beware.
    - $db is an exception. I use this so often that: (1) it would be annoying
      to prefix, and (2) anyone even slightly familiar with the code will soon
      find it obvious and does not need to be reminded that it is a global.

- Category ID -1 is special and may never exist or belong to any uid. It just
  means 'uncategorized'

- There are probably still encoding issues throughout the code, though I think
  I squashed the worst ones. It should not break on crème fraîche... mostly.
