# Multiplayer Groceries

Just putting this out here in case it is of interest to anyone. You can try
the application here: https://lucgommans.nl/p/grocerylist

Yes, the code is not pretty, in fact it's quite dated. I'm really not happy
with some choices (like treating items as strings instead of having a UID for
them, which in some cases I work around by piggy-backing off the popularitems
table).

When (if) I find more time, I'll put more info in the readme, like intended
use and how to setup.
